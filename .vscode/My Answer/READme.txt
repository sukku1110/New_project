Hello , Please find my project on the below two Questions:


1.Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
Eg - line = “which is better python 2 or python 3”

2. write a function for the below scenario.
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Following are the criteria for checking the password:
At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12

Your function should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma
Example -
input_password =asqwr1234@1,aF145#,2w3E*,2We3345 Output = asqwr1234@1

NOTE:
1.The two class file : Question1 , Question2 which contain the 
logic to the above two questions mentioned.
2.The Main function contains the __main__ and the class objects.
3. The input/variables.py contains the inputs used in the code.
